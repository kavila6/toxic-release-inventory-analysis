# Toxic Release Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes two datasets:  
1. **Water Quality in the Bay Area**  
2. **Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)**  

Our goal is to assess environmental conditions in Virginia’s aquatic ecosystems and evaluate the impact of toxic chemical releases between 2009–2019.

## Dataset 1: Water Quality

Water samples were collected bi-weekly to monitor aquatic health and compliance with Virginia State DEQ (Department of Environmental Quality) regulations.

### Key Questions

1. **How do water temperature and salinity affect dissolved oxygen solubility?**  
   - As **temperature and salinity increase**, **oxygen solubility decreases**.

2. **Does the water quality meet DEQ standards, and are adaptive controls needed?**  
   - DEQ Standards:
     - Moderate pH (7–8)
     - Dissolved Oxygen (5–8 mg/L)
     - Low Turbidity (high Secchi depth)
     - Low Salinity (0–2 ppt)
   - The Bay meets these standards with natural fluctuations; **no adaptive controls required**.


## Dataset 2: Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)

The TRI program tracks management of toxic chemicals to protect human and environmental health.

### Background

> In 1985, a toxic cloud leak at a Union Carbide plant led to new environmental regulations in 1986.

### Key Questions

1. **What is the TRI?**  
   - A federal program launched in 1986 to track toxic chemical releases across the U.S.

2. **How did chemical release distribution vary among counties and sectors?**
   - Top 3 counties for releases:
     - City of Hopewell
     - City of Covington
     - Montgomery
   - Top sectors:
     - US Army/Navy operations (highest)
     - Food industry (lowest)
   - Businesses are actively improving sustainability practices.

3. **Were there environmental impacts from 2009–2019 chemical releases?**
   - Overall quantity **decreased over time**, mitigating long-term environmental damage.


## Key Findings

- **Water quality in the Bay consistently meets DEQ standards**
- **Toxic chemical releases have declined**, suggesting improvements in environmental safety
- Most toxic emissions were via:
  - Surface water
  - Stack air emissions
- Improved water quality correlates with reduced toxic discharge

## Conclusion

The combination of water quality monitoring and toxic release tracking provides a comprehensive view of environmental health in Virginia.  
Through data analysis and visualization, this project supports informed decisions to maintain ecological integrity.
